WEB APPLICATION “COSMOS ODYSSEY”
Solar System Travel Deals
INTRO
Create Web App called “Cosmos Odyssey” that shows the best deals for our demanding customers in our solar 
system. Customers must be able to select travel between the different planets and the system should show possible 
routes-based prices. After careful consideration customer can choose to make a reservation to their name on a
specific route.
THE TASK
Through our solar system many transportation companies offer different routes and prices to travel at the given time 
until the pricelist is expired (validUntil). 
We have developed API to show active routes and prices that are available: 
https://cosmos-odyssey.azurewebsites.net/api/v1.0/TravelPrices
The pricelist updates after it is expired and customers should not be able to make a reservation after the pricelist is 
expired.
The only possible travel routes between the planets are as follows:
Before customer can make a reservation, different travel routes must be presented based on the customer selected 
origin and destination. Customer can prefer to filter the shown selection based on the travel company name and/or 
sort the result based on the price, distance or travel time. Finally, customer can make a reservation using first and 
last name as an identification.
Customers can make a reservation that stores following information:
First Name,
Last Name,
Route(s),
Total Quoted Price,
Total Quoted Travel Time,
Transportation Company Name(s)
System must store the last 15 pricelists that were active (including all the details that API provided).
Reservation details must be readable until the pricelist is no longer stored in the system, meaning it is no longer part 
of the last 15 pricelist. After this, reservation can be forgotten, deleted etc.
ADDITIONAL INFO
The solution code must be provided with a short setup guide that explains how to run your code.
